For sections we skip, have a section at the end with mini-lectures.

6.1 - Exponential Functions

  Table of Values - see 6.3
    java tables store in 2d array, check if same

  Range and Domain - Temp done
  Range
    If r > 1, then range = a to infinity
    If r < 1, then range = a to 0  
  Domain
    Negative infinity to infinity

6.2 - Exponential growth/decay
  Determine growth/decay - done
  % Rate of Change - DONE

6.3 Comparing Linear and Exponential Functions - almost done; need a way to check the user's input for what the function actually is (values of a and r)

  For decay functions, use 1/r for reasonable values
  For growth, if we want something like 1.13, use r + random decimal

6.4 Solving Exp. Equations - done, can go back and add number diversification or more formats

6.5 Geometric Sequences

  Use previous table setup

Chapter 8

8.1 
  Skip

8.2 Measuring and Constructing Segments
  Find AC
    Draw a line segment, points on it labelled A,B,C
      between A B, between B C, have variables x and y, set these variables equal to random integers

8.3 Midpoint/Distance Formulas
  Follow the formula using random variables

8.4 Perimeter/Area
  skip

8.5 Measuring and Contructing Angles
  Random A, with a bisecting angle creating the B, C angles, set B, C, equal to an expression in terms of x.

8.6 Describing Pairs of Angles
  Complements: Random angle from 1-90, just subtract from 90
  Supplements: same idea

9.1
  skip

9.2 Inductive and Deductive Reasoning
  skip

9.3 Postulates and Diagrams
  Hard to do, redirect user to website that can explain
  Important part is postulates 

9.4 Proving Statements about Segments and Angles
  Proofs - impossible??

9.5 Geometric Proofs
  ^^

10.1 Pairs of Lines and Angles
  Multiple Choice - provide image, no need for scale

10.2 Parallel Lines and Transversals
  Predrawn diagram not to scale, with value in certain areas and expression in other - refer to chapter review
    Perhaps some preset diagrams, else diagrams will be too far off

10.3 Proofs with Parallel lines - refer to chapter review
  Predrawn diagram, variable angles

10.4 Proofs with Perpendicular Lines
  skip

10.5 Using Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
  Have a box for answer, calculate the distance behind the scenes
  Find distance from a point off of line TO the line
  Distance between two parallel lines

Chapter 11 - According to Enriquez, only going over rotating about the origin

11.1 Translations
  No diagram, randomize coords and vectors
  Input: 2 boxes with parentheses around them, determine # of boxes based on variable 2-4 (how many points)

11.2 Reflections
  No diagram, just input boxes
  Var 1-3, determine if flip over x, y, or y=x

11.3 Rotations
  No need for diagrams
  # 1-3, 1 = 90 degrees, 2 = 180 degrees, etc

11.4 Congruence and Transformations
  Skip - tell user to refer elsewhere

Chapter 12 - (12.7 optional)
  12.1 Angles of Triangles
    Have diagrams not drawn to scale, have x y z
    Make sure to check and make sure the angles make sense for the predrawn triangles

  12.2 Congruent Polygons
    skip

  12.3 Proving Triangle Congruence
    skip - no way to randomize or collect input

  12.4 Equilateral and Isosceles Triangles
    skip 

  12.5-12.6
    skip - no way to randomize all the triangles
